# European-Football-Analysis
This is a fictitious python based project looking at European football data to identify potential patterns and trends in the data, aswell as identifying players who could be worth recruiting for elite football teams.
# Objective
The use of data in football has now become essential for all clubs in the pursuit of enhanced performance of both the sporting and business aspects of the club. Utilising this data means a club can not only improve the performances of players already acquired, but also recruit new signings who might take a team to the next level. Using data from the 21/22 season (Source: fbref.com) for the Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Ligue 1 and Seria A, we will take a look at which up and coming players recruitment teams might be considering ahead of the new season, making recommendations to this effect. For the purpose of this analysis, 'up and coming' is defined as players aged 23 or below.
